## 📝 Project Description
We will use an open API to get weather data then customize it to our needs. User can retrieve weather information by typing the city name. The application gets realtime data from **OpenWeatherMap API** and formats it into a clean and readable JSON structure.
The project will also have a **frontpage** to guide user on how to use the API and live testing of the API. The project will be developed in compliance with WCAG guidelines so that the the code and webpage is accessible. We will also make a product page where the user can buy products related to temprature measuring to put in/around their surroundings. The product page will have products API which can perform CRUD to add delete and update products on the store page.
